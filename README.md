# Netflix Stock Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of Netflix (NFLX) using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM model is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series data and has been implemented to predict future stock prices based on historical stock data.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to predict Netflix's stock price using historical stock data such as adjusted closing prices. This is achieved by:
- Preprocessing the data (e.g., normalizing and splitting it into training and validation sets).
- Utilizing an LSTM model to capture the patterns in the time series data.
- Evaluating the model's performance by comparing predicted stock prices with actual stock prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical stock price data for Netflix, which includes:
- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Adjusted Close (used for model training)
- Volume

The data can be obtained from financial data providers such as Yahoo Finance.

## Model Architecture

The model is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, designed to handle sequential time series data. The key steps in building the model include:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Convert the date column to datetime format and set it as the index.
   - Scale the `Adj Close` column to normalize the input data.
   - Create a sliding window of the stock prices to prepare sequences for the LSTM model.
   
2. **LSTM Model**:
   - The model takes a sequence of past stock prices as input and predicts the next stock price.
   - The model has layers:
     - LSTM layers to capture the temporal dependencies.
     - Dense layer for final prediction.

3. **Training and Validation**:
   - The data is split into training and validation sets (e.g., 80% training and 20% validation).
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used as the loss function.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netflix-stock-prediction.git
   cd netflix-stock-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the Netflix stock data from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/history?p=NFLX) or any other financial data provider.

## Usage

1. Preprocess the data and set up the sequences:
   ```python
   df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
   df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

   X, y = sequences(df['Adj Close'].values, time_steps=30)
   ```

2. Train the LSTM model:
   ```python
   model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32)
   ```

3. Make predictions:
   ```python
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

4. Visualize the results:
   ```python
   plt.plot(df.index[-len(y_pred):], y_pred, label='Predicted')
   plt.plot(df.index[-len(y_test):], y_test, label='Actual')
   plt.show()
   ```

## Results

The LSTM model provides predictions of the stock price, which can be compared to the actual stock prices. A sample plot comparing predicted prices to actual prices is shown below:
